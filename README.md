# CS-303---Assignment-2

The main goal of the code is to create professional and nonprofessional employees lists, containing weekly salary, healthy care contribution and vacations days earned.

To run the code, it just requires you to run the main file, where all the files are included on it, making it run perfectly.

Employee.cpp file creates the math for the calculations
Employee.h file creates the class and functions
Single_Linked_List.cpp creates all the functions for positioning
Single_Linked_List.h use all the operations for the functions
main runs the code.

Here is a screenshot of how the code runs:
